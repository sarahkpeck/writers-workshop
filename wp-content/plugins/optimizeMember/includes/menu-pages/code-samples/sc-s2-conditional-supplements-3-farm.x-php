	This Member CANNOT access Level #4,

		Notice that NESTED Conditionals require a preceding underscore ( i.e. _opmIf, __opmIf, ___opmIf ).
			You can go up to three levels deep ( ___opmIf ).
				
					Nested PayPal Form/Button Shortcodes ARE fine too.
					However, you do NOT need a preceding underscore on Form/Button codes. Or any other Shortcode for that matter.
					You ONLY need the preceding underscore on _opmIf Conditionals that are being nested into each other.
					
					( Hi [opmGet constant="OPTIMIZEMEMBER_CURRENT_USER_DISPLAY_NAME" /], upgrade now to Level #4! )
					[optimizeMember-PayPal-Button level="4" ra="49.95" ... /]
						~ see, this will work just fine.
