== Translations ==

optimizeMember and optimizeMember Pro are now equipped with support for front-end translation, using standardized WordPress methodologies; i.e. we've implemented the use of `_x()`, and various other translation routines for many aspects of optimizeMember's front-end interfaces. For instance, things like Profile panels, Login/Registration Fields, and Pro Form integrations; as well as error messages displayed to Users/Members. Translation support for back-end admin panels provided by optimizeMember will come in a future release, along with more extensive translation support for front-end aspects.

Please note, this is but our first step toward internationalizing optimizeMember and optimizeMember Pro. Look for further updates/improvements to come in the future.

Like WordPress itself, we chose to use the GNU `gettext` localization framework to provide localization infrastructure for optimizeMember. GNU `gettext` is a mature, widely used framework for modular translation of software, and is the *de facto* standard for localization in the open source/free software realm. If you'd like to translate optimizeMember and/or optimizeMember Pro, please use the POT file found inside `/s2member/includes/translations/s2member.pot`, which contains all translation entries for both the optimizeMember Framework *( i.e. the free version )*, and also for optimizeMember Pro.

The file: `/s2member/includes/translations/s2member.pot` will be updated with each new release of optimizeMember.

If this is your first translation of a WordPress plugin, [this article](http://codex.wordpress.org/Translating_WordPress#Localization_Technology) and/or [this article](http://urbangiraffe.com/articles/translating-wordpress-themes-and-plugins/), might be of some assistance. When you are finished translating the `s2member.pot` file, place your completed `s2member-[locale].mo` file into this directory: `/wp-content/plugins/`; and please feel free to [share your translation](http://www.optimizepress.com/forums/forum/community/) with the rest of the optimizeMember community.

Quick Tip: If you only need to translate the front-end of optimizeMember, please ignore entries in the `s2member.pot` file with a context matching `s2member-admin`. Those sections of optimizeMember are only seen by site Administrators; they are NOT used in optimizeMember's front-end integration with WordPress. Skipping over translation entries with a context matching `s2member-admin` can save you time.
